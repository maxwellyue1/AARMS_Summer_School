# AARMS_Summer_School

This repository was made for the final project of the AARMS summer school on Emerging Infectious Disease Modeling 2023, held at Bonne Bay Marine Station, Norris Point NL CA, by Rhiannon Loster, Benjamin Benteke, and Pengfei Yue. For this project we discuss behaviour change in an epidemic, specifically modeling how pandemic fatigue affects non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) compliance and how this affects the trajectory and dynamics of an epidemic.

# Getting Started

This repository is written in both R Markdown and in Jupyter Notebook. 

The pdf file "AARMS_Project_2023.pdf" goes through a detailed explanation about the constructed model, as well as discusses the affect certain parameters have on both the trajectory of the number of infected individuals and the percent compliance with NPIs. This file will also go over some possible suggestions on how governments and individuals in positions of leadership can help reduce pandemic fatigue and improve overall public compliance with NPIs. 

The main code can be found as an R Markdown file "AARMS_Project_2023.Rmd". This code will take you through a step-by-step process of how the suggested model was coded and can be used for further model investigation and to recreate figures shown in the "AARMS_Project_2023.pdf" file.

Lastly, the permanent aspect of this project included this repository, as well as a ShinyApp created for user friendly investigation of parameters within the model. The code used to create this ShinyApp can be found within this repository under "app.R" as an R file. The app itself can be found at https://rloster.shinyapps.io/AARMS2023/
